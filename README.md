# My personal website

The website was built with Jekyll and the *Minimal Mistakes* theme (by [Michael Rose](https://mademistakes.com)) with a few tweaks stolen from [Grant McDermott](http://grantmcdermott.github.io) and [Pawe≈Ç Budzianowski](http://budzianowski.github.io) and a few other tweaks of my own.
