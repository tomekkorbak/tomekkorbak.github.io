I'm a PhD student at the Department of Informatics, University of Sussex working on deep reinforcement learning, generative models and computational neuroscience with [Chris Buckley](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=nWuZ0XcAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Anil Seth](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=3eJCZCkAAAAJ). Currently, I'm focusing on biologically-inspired learning schemes for deep neural networks and probabilistic approaches to control, such as active inference and control-as-inference.

Before that, I studied cognitive science, philosophy and physics at the University of Warsaw. While there, I worked on compositionality and communication in multi-agent systems at [Human Interactivity and Language Lab](http://hill.psych.uw.edu.pl) with [Joanna Rączaszek-Leonardi](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Joanna_Rczaszek-Leonardi2) and on probabilistic accounts of life and cognition with [Marcin Miłkowski](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2UfI6q8AAAAJ&hl=en).
